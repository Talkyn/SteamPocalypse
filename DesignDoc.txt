A roguelike* game set in a unique, alternate-history, post-apocalyptical world.

    *A genre of games inspired by "Rogue", created in the 1980s using text
    characters placed on-screen to draw a primitive top-down graphical view.
    See RogueBasin for more information on the genre:

Summary:

    The player takes the role of an inexperienced alchemist, an apprentice,
    searching for bits of lost knowledge from the past.  Exploring ancient
    ruins while overcoming hazards and evading or defeating monsters in order
    to uncover fragments of alchemical knowledge.  These fragments will take a
    couple of forms, some as crafting blueprints and others as collectible
    buffs that improve some aspect of the character.  Various rare materials 
    and reagents will be collected and used to craft consumables, weapons,
    armours, and specialized tools (to enhance exploration via light, trap
    negation, door unlocking, etc).  Explore to complete quests, gain 
    abilities, improve and specialize your character, uncover the lore of a 
    shattered world, discover a sinister plot and attempt to thwart it.
    ...or perhaps ensure it's success.

Setting:

    Imagine a world, much like Renaissance Europe, where the labour of 
    Alchemists bore much more fruit than our own.  A world where the 4 element
    theory was correct, phlogiston theory came into practical application.  
    Instead of the downfall of Alchemy and the rise of Chemistry, Alchemy reins
    supreme. DaVincian machines could be amply powered by highly-efficient, 
    phlogiston-burning steam engines.  Transmutation allowed for the creation 
    of all manner of specialized materials, including metals that would be 
    named from legends.  The very nature of the being was exploited to animate 
    golems made first of wood, then metals...even flesh.  It was Utopia.  An 
    era of plenty, prosperity and progress.  It would also be an era of war.  
    At first it was the have-nots, tired of ever-existing in the shadow of 
    wealthy nations.  Later, it would be among Alchemists and inventors over 
    precious materials and secrets.  Near the end, great nations wrought 
    annihilation upon each other over petty insults, political scheming, 
    mistrust, revenge, and jealousy.

    How it all ended is still a mystery.  It was hundreds of years ago and most
    folk are too worried about making it through the next winter to be bothered 
    with anything else.  Some say the very Earth was wounded in some great 
    attack, other say Sol grew weary of his children's hubris and squabbling, 
    some say we mostly just killed each other off until there was nobody left.  

    Monstrosities roam the wilds, relics of beasts created for war, hungry and 
    spiteful.  Huge regions are impossibly contrasted, some with strange 
    climates, perpetual darkness, noxious or maddening fumes, or merely immense
    craters that make travel nearly impossible.  Few are brave enough to 
    venture beyond where they are born, and most folk live as primitives.  
    Hunter-gatherer tribes roam in some regions and tiny farm-villages eke 
    existences out of the soil.  But there are a handful that strive to 
    understand the past and the power of Alchemy.  You are one of those few.

Goals:

- Crafting based roguelike.  A large part of progression will be finding 
alchemical secrets, collecting the reagents and crafting items.  Traps, 
grenades, specialized metals, fancy crossbows and firearms will provide a 
large array of weapons beyond sword, axe, spear.

- Sensible looting system.  No rats dropping longswords or wolves carrying
around a few hundred gold pieces.  Humanoid creatures will have full equipment
sets, while other creatures types will be sensibly bare.  Loot will tie 
strongly to the crafting system, and many reagents will be harvestable from
corpses.  Liquid humours, specialized organic compounds, rare flora and
other components will be a major part of what loot is.

- Reward and encourage exploration.  Alchemical secrets and reagents will be 
scattered with the intent of allowing a character to be more powerful the 
farther afield they roam.  This will also be a balancing mechanism since a 
character will consequently be older the more exploration they have done.

- More than a hack-n-slash.  I aim to provide tactical combat powered by 
choices.  There will be plenty of enemies with various behaviours, strengths 
and weaknesses for a clever player to strategize against.

- Beautiful.  A strange goal for an ASCII game, but I firmly believe that 
with a well chosen font and attention to colour and detail an eye-pleasing 
ASCII game is achievable.  The game will have varied characters and colours 
to represent meadow, grass, brush, ferns, dirt, stone, mud, marsh...rather than
floor.  Dungeons are areas will be constructed with pallets to ensure they help
evoke their theme.

- Unique and understandable RPG system.  Many roguelikes borrow from d20, others 
have extremely complex rolling and resolution mechanics.  As a hobby table-top 
system creator, I will draft and implement a unique and transparent rolling and 
resolution system that is intuitive and satisfying. 

- A rich world full of lore.  Alongside the character-driven benefits of 
exploration and discovery, the story of the world will be slowly unravelled
by (optional-to-read) text passages, quests and the main plot.  This should
be seamlessly blended into mechanical content, providing the extra depth for
players that choose to consume it without obnoxiously interrupting players that
do not.

- Main story with branching choices.  The player can choose (encounter) more
than one entry point, with the game taking the plot to the character at a
certain point in progression if they choose to ignore the lead-in quests.  A
seemingly good/bad choice early on will become more complex, with (at least 
some of) the ultimate conclusions being free of objectively good/bad choice.
Once the base game is "winnable", alternate/secret and more challenging endings
can be added.
